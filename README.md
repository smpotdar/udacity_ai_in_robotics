# udacity_ai_in_robotics
My work from AI in Robotics taught by Sebastien Thrun on Udacity.

Implemented Kalman Filter, Particle filter using python for robot localisation.

Used Dynamic Programming, Depth First Search, A-Star and Hybrid-Astar for Planning

Implement PID controller for controlling robot steering.

The physical implementation of the concepts I learnt in this course was done using a car-like mobile robot and can be found at: http://smpotdar.com/autonav/

The corresponding code for the physical implementation can be found at: https://github.com/smpotdar/FYP_Auto_Nav
